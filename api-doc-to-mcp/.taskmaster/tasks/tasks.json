Integrate the output of the parser with the MCP server generator module from Task 12, mapping parsed entities to MCP Tools, Resources, and Prompts as specified.\n3. Automate the process to generate a working MCP server from the parsed documentation, ensuring the server exposes all expected endpoints and metadata.\n4. Implement test logic to launch the generated MCP server and connect to it using Claude Desktop, verifying that the server responds correctly to tool invocations and resource queries.\n5. Ensure the test covers the complete flow: documentation parsing → MCP server generation → server startup → Claude Desktop interaction.\n6. Update test fixtures and mocks as needed to support the new parser and server generator interfaces. Document any changes to test setup or teardown procedures.",
        "testStrategy": "- Run the end-to-end test, starting from LangGraph documentation input and proceeding through parsing, MCP server generation, and server startup.\n- Use Claude Desktop to connect to the generated MCP server and execute representative tool calls and resource queries.\n- Assert that all expected MCP Tools, Resources, and Prompts are present and function as intended.\n- Validate that the server handles real-world documentation edge cases (e.g., overloaded methods, nested classes, complex type hints).\n- Confirm that the test fails gracefully if any step in the flow is unsuccessful, with clear error reporting.\n- Review logs and outputs to ensure the parser and generator are invoked as expected and that the integration with Claude Desktop is robust.",
