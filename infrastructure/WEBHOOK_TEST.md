# Webhook Test

This file is created to test the webhook automation after self-update.

Timestamp: 2025-07-05 21:25:00 UTC

The webhook should:
1. Receive this push event
2. Apply self-update if needed (already done)
3. Clone the repository using new GitHub App credentials
4. Run Terragrunt deployment

If successful, this proves the complete webhook automation pipeline is working.
