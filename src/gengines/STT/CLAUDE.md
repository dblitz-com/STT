# Zeus VLA - Claude Development Notes

## Project Overview  
Open-source Vision Language Action (VLA) system for macOS that maintains **continuous multimodal awareness** - understanding what you see, hear, and do - to enable natural interactions like "what did they say in the meeting?" or "what error was on screen earlier?"

## 🥽 Glass UI Design Philosophy

Zeus VLA adopts the **minimalist Glass UI** design pattern inspired by [Pickle Glass](https://github.com/pickle-com/glass) - a "liquid glass" interface that prioritizes invisibility and user focus.

### Core Design Principles

#### 1. **Invisible by Default**
- **Truly transparent**: Never appears in screen recordings or screenshots
- **No dock presence**: Doesn't clutter the macOS dock or window management
- **Click-through mode**: Glass interface allows interaction with underlying apps

#### 2. **Liquid Glass Aesthetic**
```css
/* Glass Bypass Pattern */
body.has-glass * {
    animation: none !important;
    transition: none !important;
    background: transparent !important;
    border: none !important;
    box-shadow: none !important;
    backdrop-filter: none !important;
}
```

#### 3. **Context-Aware Visibility**
- **Appears only when needed**: Triggered by keyboard shortcuts or system events
- **Adaptive opacity**: Adjusts based on user activity and focus
- **Minimal cognitive load**: Clean, distraction-free interface

### UI Architecture

#### **Glass Window Management**
- **Frameless windows**: No traditional window chrome or decorations
- **Floating overlays**: Hover above all applications without interruption
- **Smart positioning**: Automatically positions to avoid content occlusion
- **Keyboard navigation**: Full functionality accessible via shortcuts

#### **Visual Hierarchy**
- **Typography**: Clean, readable fonts with high contrast
- **Color palette**: Minimal, monochromatic with accent colors for status
- **Spacing**: Generous whitespace for visual breathing room
- **Icons**: Simple, recognizable symbols for quick comprehension

### Integration with Zeus VLA

#### **Continuous Vision Integration**
- Glass UI appears when vision system detects significant changes
- Temporal queries trigger subtle, contextual glass overlays
- Workflow transitions provide gentle visual feedback

#### **Keyboard Shortcuts**
- `⌘ + \`: Toggle main glass interface
- `⌘ + Enter`: Quick AI query with context
- `⌘ + Arrows`: Reposition glass windows
- `⌘ + Escape`: Hide all glass elements

### Implementation Strategy

#### **Phase 1: Core Glass Framework**
- [ ] Implement frameless window system
- [ ] Add click-through functionality
- [ ] Create glass CSS framework
- [ ] Integrate with existing vision service

#### **Phase 2: Advanced Glass Features**
- [ ] Adaptive opacity based on system state
- [ ] Smart positioning algorithms
- [ ] Gesture-based interactions
- [ ] Screen recording bypass

#### **Phase 3: AI-Powered Glass**

### Technical Benefits

- **Reduced cognitive overhead**: Minimal visual distraction
- **Enhanced focus**: Users stay in flow state with their primary tasks
- **Seamless integration**: Feels like a natural extension of macOS
- **Privacy-first**: Invisible to external observers and recordings

The Glass UI philosophy aligns perfectly with Zeus VLA's vision of **continuous multimodal awareness** - providing intelligence without interruption, insights without intrusion.
