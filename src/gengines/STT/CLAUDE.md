# STT Dictate - Claude Development Notes

## Project Overview
Open-source voice-to-text system for Mac that intercepts the Fn key to toggle dictation, preventing the emoji picker and providing universal text insertion across all applications.

## Key Requirements
- Intercept Fn/Globe key globally across all macOS applications
- Prevent system emoji picker from appearing when Fn is pressed
- Insert transcribed text into any active application
- Run as background service with minimal UI (menu bar icon)

## Technical Architecture
- **Core Engine**: WhisperKit with large-v3-turbo model for speech recognition
- **Audio Processing**: AVAudioEngine for real-time capture
- **Event Interception**: CGEventTap for global hotkey detection
- **Text Insertion**: CGEvent keyboard simulation for universal compatibility
- **App Structure**: macOS app bundle with LaunchAgent for auto-start

## Major Challenge: Fn Key Interception

### Problem
The Fn/Globe key operates at a hardware/firmware level and is heavily controlled by macOS system services. Standard event interception methods often fail because:

1. **System Priority**: macOS consumes Fn events for built-in features (emoji, dictation, window management)
2. **Hardware Level**: Fn is processed by keyboard firmware before reaching software
3. **Security Restrictions**: Recent macOS versions (Sonoma/Sequoia) have tightened event tap permissions

### Solutions Attempted

#### 1. NSEvent Global Monitor (Failed)
- **Method**: `NSEvent.addGlobalMonitorForEvents(matching: .flagsChanged)`
- **Issue**: Passive monitoring only, cannot consume/prevent system actions
- **Result**: Emoji picker still appeared

#### 2. CGEventTap with Session Level (Failed)
- **Method**: `CGEvent.tapCreate()` with `.cgSessionEventTap`
- **Issue**: System consumed Fn events before reaching our tap
- **Result**: Callback never triggered

#### 3. CGEventTap with Hardware Level (Current)
- **Method**: `CGEvent.tapCreate()` with `.cghidEventTap`
- **Events**: Monitor `.flagsChanged`, `.keyDown`, `.keyUp`
- **Flag**: Detect `CGEventFlags.maskSecondaryFn`
- **Status**: Enhanced with Sequoia-specific fixes

### Required Permissions (Critical for Sonoma/Sequoia)
1. **Accessibility**: System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility
2. **Input Monitoring**: System Settings > Privacy & Security > Input Monitoring (NEW requirement)

### System Settings Modifications
```bash
# Disable Fn emoji picker
defaults write -g AppleFnUsageType -int 0

# Force standard F-keys behavior
defaults write -g com.apple.keyboard.fnState -bool true
```

### Current Implementation Status - Wispr Flow Approach
- ✅ **App Sandboxing Disabled** - Unrestricted system access like Wispr Flow
- ✅ **Entitlements Applied** - Proper code signing with security entitlements
- ✅ **System Optimizations** - Auto-disables emoji picker and Fn conflicts
- ✅ **Debug Mode** - Listen-only testing to verify event reception
- ✅ **Enhanced CGEventTap** - Hardware-level with Sequoia compatibility
- ✅ **Dual Permission Support** - Accessibility + Input Monitoring
- ✅ **Hidutil Fallback** - Alternative remapping approach if needed
- ❓ **Testing Required** - Both permission types must be granted

### Fallback Solutions (If Current Approach Fails)

#### 1. hidutil Remapping
```bash
# Remap Fn to unused key code, then intercept that
hidutil property --set '{"UserKeyMapping":[{"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc":0x700000065,"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst":0x7000000FF}]}'
```

#### 2. IOKit/HID Level Filtering
- Use IOHIDManager for raw HID report filtering
- Intercept at driver level before system processing
- Requires deep low-level programming

#### 3. Integration with Karabiner-Elements
- Study open-source implementation
- Use proven methods for Fn key remapping
- Consider as dependency or port logic

## Build & Installation

### Quick Start
```bash
./setup.sh              # Install dependencies and download models
./build-app.sh           # Build macOS app bundle
mv "STT Dictate.app" /Applications/
./install-service.sh     # Install as background service
```

### Development Commands
```bash
swift build              # Build for testing
swift run STTDictate     # Run directly (for debugging)
./fix-fn-key.sh         # Fix system Fn key settings
./test-fn-key.swift     # Simulate Fn key presses
```

## Testing & Debugging

### Check Permissions
- Accessibility: Required for event taps
- Input Monitoring: Required for keyboard events in Sonoma+
- Microphone: Required for speech recognition

### Debug Output
The app provides extensive logging for troubleshooting:
- Event tap creation and status
- Permission checks
- System settings verification
- Real-time event detection

### Common Issues
1. **No events received**: Missing Input Monitoring permission
2. **Emoji still appears**: System settings not properly disabled
3. **App crashes**: Insufficient code signing or wrong location

## Future Improvements
- Alternative hotkey options (if Fn proves unreliable)
- Voice activity detection for automatic start/stop
- Custom command processing
- Multi-language support
- Cloud model options
