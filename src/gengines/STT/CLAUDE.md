## 🔒 Privacy & Security
- **Local Processing**: All vision analysis on-device
- **Data Encryption**: Fernet encryption for storage (planned)
- **Access Control**: Group-based isolation
- **Retention**: Configurable data lifecycle

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions
1. **spaCy Memory Usage** (383MB from temporal parser vs 200MB target)
   - Root cause: `en_core_web_sm` model = 383MB (87% of total memory)
   - Research solution: Custom minimal spaCy (blank + NER + parser) = ~80MB
   - Alternative: NLTK + dateutil approach = <10MB  
   - Status: Documented, not blocking current work
   
2. **PyObjC Import Errors**
   - Solution: Use fallback constants for older versions
   
3. **Neo4j Connection**
   - Solution: Ensure `brew services start neo4j`
