# Research Prompt: Glass UI Text Display Issue

## Problem Statement
The Zeus VLA Glass UI window is visible but text content is not displaying when menu buttons are clicked. The GlassViewModel is working correctly (tests show text is being set), but the SwiftUI view is not updating to show the text.

## Current Symptoms
- ✅ Glass UI window appears when "Show Glass UI" is clicked
- ✅ Window has proper transparency and positioning
- ✅ GlassViewModel state updates correctly (debug logs show text being set)
- ❌ No text content visible in the Glass UI window
- ❌ Menu buttons like "Test Vision Summary" don't display text

## Technical Context
- **Architecture**: SwiftUI views with @ObservedObject GlassViewModel
- **Threading**: @MainActor isolation for concurrency
- **Window Management**: NSWindow with NSHostingView for SwiftUI content
- **State Management**: @Published properties in GlassViewModel

## Files to Analyze
1. `/Users/devin/dblitz/engine/src/gengines/STT/GlassUI/Sources/GlassUI/GlassView.swift` - SwiftUI view implementation
2. `/Users/devin/dblitz/engine/src/gengines/STT/GlassUI/Sources/GlassUI/GlassViewModel.swift` - State management
3. `/Users/devin/dblitz/engine/src/gengines/STT/GlassUI/Sources/GlassUI/GlassManager.swift` - Window/view coordination
4. `/Users/devin/dblitz/engine/src/gengines/STT/GlassUI/Sources/GlassUI/GlassWindow.swift` - NSWindow implementation

## Research Questions
1. **SwiftUI View Updates**: Why isn't the SwiftUI view updating when @Published properties change?
2. **NSHostingView Integration**: Is the NSHostingView properly connected to the SwiftUI view?
3. **Threading Issues**: Are view updates happening on the wrong thread despite @MainActor?
4. **View Model Binding**: Is the @ObservedObject properly bound to the SwiftUI view?
5. **Window Content Setup**: Is the window's contentView properly configured for SwiftUI?

## Expected Behavior
When clicking "Show Glass UI" button:
1. GlassManager.displayVisionSummary() should be called
2. GlassViewModel.showVisionSummary() should set text and visibility
3. SwiftUI view should update to display the text content
4. Text should be visible in the Glass UI window

## Debug Evidence
- GlassViewModel debug logs show text being set correctly
- Window is visible with proper transparency
- Tests pass for individual components
- Issue appears to be in the SwiftUI view layer

## Research Objective
Identify the root cause of why SwiftUI views are not updating despite correct state management, and provide a specific technical fix to make text content visible in the Glass UI window.
