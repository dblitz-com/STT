# STT Dictate Test Status

## Fixed Issues ✅
1. **Single Instance Check** - App now prevents multiple instances from running
2. **Menu Click Actions** - Fixed selector syntax and target assignment
3. **WhisperKit Initialization** - Added proper checks before starting recording
4. **Error Handling** - Added comprehensive try-catch blocks and logging
5. **Recording State Management** - Better state tracking and visual feedback

## Current Test Plan

### Step 1: Basic Menu Functionality
1. ⚡ lightning bolt should appear in menu bar
2. Click the icon → menu should appear
3. Try "Test Menu (Flash Icon)" → should see ✅ → ❌ → ⚡ sequence

### Step 2: Microphone Test
1. Click "Test Microphone" → should request microphone permission
2. Should show permission status in an alert

### Step 3: Toggle Dictation Test
1. Click "Toggle Dictation (Fn)" → should either:
   - Show "STT Not Ready" if WhisperKit still loading
   - Request microphone permission if not granted
   - Start recording if everything is ready

### Expected Behavior
- **If WhisperKit not ready**: Notification saying "WhisperKit is still loading"
- **If mic permission denied**: Alert asking for microphone access
- **If everything ready**: Should start recording (red icon) and show notification

## Next Steps After Menu Testing
1. Verify dictation toggle works without crashing
2. Test actual speech-to-text functionality  
3. Debug Fn key interception (the original goal)
4. Test text insertion into other apps

## To Test Now
Please try clicking the ⚡ icon and testing each menu item in order:
1. "Test Menu (Flash Icon)" - should just flash colors
2. "Test Microphone" - should check permissions
3. "Toggle Dictation (Fn)" - should try to start recording
