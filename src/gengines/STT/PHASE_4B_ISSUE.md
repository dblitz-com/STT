# Issue: Phase 4B VAD Auto-Stop Not Working End-to-End

## Summary
Phase 4B VAD auto-stop functionality has been implemented but is not triggering as expected during live usage. While individual components test successfully, the end-to-end flow where speech automatically stops recording after silence is not working.

## Current Status
- ✅ VAD processor (Silero) working correctly
- ✅ Wake word detection triggers recording
- ✅ State machine transitions implemented
- ✅ Energy-based silence detection coded
- ❌ Auto-stop not triggering after speech ends
- ❌ Logging output not visible (possible DEBUG build issue)

## Branch
`feature/phase-4a-hands-free` (commit: 4c29c82)

## Technical Details

### What Was Implemented:
1. `processHandsFreeVAD()` function with:
   - Energy-based silence detection
   - Consecutive silence chunk tracking (8 chunks = 800ms)
   - Minimum recording duration (1 second)
   - Silero VAD integration for accuracy

2. State machine flow:
   ```
   idle → wakeWordDetected → recording → processing → inserting → idle
   ```

3. Auto-stop trigger conditions:
   - 800ms of consecutive silence
   - Minimum 1 second recording elapsed
   - Energy below threshold (0.001)

### Suspected Issues:
1. **Logging not visible**: NSLog calls may be stripped in DEBUG builds or redirected to stderr
2. **VAD not being called**: `handsFreeState` might not be `.recording` when expected
3. **Threading issues**: VAD processing on background queue may have timing problems
4. **Audio buffer issues**: Samples might not be reaching VAD processor correctly

## Reproduction Steps
1. Launch Zeus_STT Dev app
2. Say "Hey Jarvis" (wake word)
3. Recording starts (confirmed working)
4. Say a message like "Hello world"
5. Stop speaking and wait 1-2 seconds
6. **Expected**: Recording auto-stops and text is inserted
7. **Actual**: Must manually press button to stop recording

## Debug Commands
```bash
# Test components individually
./test-phase4b-final.py

# Monitor logs (if they appear)
log stream --process STTDictate --level debug

# Check Console.app with:
- Search: STTDictate
- Enable: Include Debug Messages
```

## Priority
Medium - Core functionality works (wake word → record → manual stop → insert). Auto-stop is a UX improvement.

## Next Steps
1. Fix logging visibility issue first
2. Add print statements to trace execution flow
3. Verify `handsFreeState` transitions
4. Test with longer silence thresholds
5. Consider alternative VAD approach if current one fails
