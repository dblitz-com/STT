# STT Dictate Menu Fix Status

## What was wrong:
1. The selector `#selector(statusItemClicked)` was missing the parameter syntax - should be `#selector(statusItemClicked(_:))`
2. Menu was stored but not assigned to the status item
3. Custom click handling was interfering with standard menu behavior

## What I fixed:
1. **Removed custom click handler** - When you assign a menu to statusItem.menu, macOS handles all the clicking automatically
2. **Assigned menu directly** - Changed from storing menu to `statusItem?.menu = menu`
3. **Kept explicit targets** - All menu items have `.target = self` set explicitly (required for agent apps)

## Current implementation:
- Click the ⚡ icon → Menu should appear
- Select "Toggle Dictation" → Should show an alert dialog
- Select "Test Microphone" → Should show microphone permission status
- Select "Test Menu" → Should flash the icon (✅ → ❌ → ⚡)

## To test:
1. The app is now running in /Applications/STT Dictate.app
2. Look for ⚡ lightning bolt in menu bar
3. Click it - menu should appear
4. Try each menu item

## If still not working:
The issue might be deeper - possibly related to the event loop or how the app is initialized. The simple test script works because it has no additional complexity.
