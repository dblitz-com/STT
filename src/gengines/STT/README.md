# STT Dictate - Production-Ready Voice-to-Text with Session-Based AI

**PRODUCTION-READY** open-source voice-to-text system for Mac with **breakthrough session-based AI editing**. Intercepts the Fn key to toggle dictation and provides universal text insertion with intelligent post-processing that rivals Wispr Flow.

## ðŸš€ Breakthrough: Session-Based AI Architecture

**The Problem We Solved**: Traditional dictation apps process text word-by-word during recording, creating repetitive, choppy output.

**Our Solution**: 
1. **Record Session**: Accumulate entire conversation in buffer
2. **Process Once**: When recording ends, AI processes complete text  
3. **Insert Instantly**: Paste final enhanced text via clipboard

**Result**: Smooth, polished text that flows naturally - comparable to Wispr Flow.

## âœ… Production Features

- **Perfect Fn Key Detection**: Hardware-level CGEventTap with Sequoia compatibility
- **Session-Based AI Editing**: Processes entire conversation once at end (not word-by-word)
- **Instant Text Insertion**: Clipboard-based paste for immediate output
- **Zero Text During Recording**: Clean UX - text appears only when session ends
- **AI Enhancement**: Grammar correction, filler removal, punctuation via local Ollama
- **Context Awareness**: App-specific tone matching and smart formatting
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works in all macOS applications
- **Fully Offline**: Local AI processing with privacy protection

## Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
./setup.sh                    # Install dependencies and models
./build-app.sh                # Build production app
mv "STT Dictate.app" /Applications/
```

### Required Permissions
1. **Accessibility**: System Settings â†’ Privacy & Security â†’ Accessibility
2. **Input Monitoring**: System Settings â†’ Privacy & Security â†’ Input Monitoring  
3. **Microphone**: System Settings â†’ Privacy & Security â†’ Microphone

### Usage
1. Press **Fn** to start recording (ðŸŽ¤ icon appears)
2. Speak your entire message/conversation
3. Press **Fn** again to stop
4. AI processes and inserts enhanced text instantly

## Development Workflow

### Production vs Development
```bash
# Production build (stable daily-use version)
./build-app.sh
mv "STT Dictate.app" /Applications/

# Development build (testing new features)
./build-dev.sh
mv "STT Dictate Dev.app" /Applications/
```

Both versions can run simultaneously with different bundle IDs.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **WhisperKit**: Large-v3-turbo model for speech recognition
- **AVAudioEngine**: Real-time audio capture and processing
- **CGEventTap**: Hardware-level Fn key interception
- **Session Buffer**: Accumulates text during recording
- **AI Pipeline**: Python scripts with Ollama for text enhancement
- **Paste Insertion**: NSPasteboard + CGEvent for instant text output

### Session-Based Processing Flow
```
Fn Press â†’ Start Recording â†’ Audio Buffer â†’ WhisperKit STT â†’ Session Buffer
                â†“
Session Buffer â†’ AI Processing â†’ Enhanced Text â†’ Clipboard â†’ Paste â†’ Done
```

### AI Enhancement Features
- **Filler Removal**: Eliminates "um", "uh", "like", etc.
- **Grammar Correction**: Fixes sentence structure and verb tenses
- **Punctuation**: Adds periods, commas, capitalization
- **Context Matching**: Formal tone for email, casual for chat
- **Command Processing**: Voice commands for text editing

## Requirements

- macOS 14+ (Sequoia recommended)
- Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) or Intel
- Xcode Command Line Tools
- Python 3.8+ with Ollama for AI enhancement

## Performance

- **Accuracy**: 95-98% speech recognition
- **AI Processing**: 1-2 second enhancement pipeline  
- **Insertion**: Instant paste (no character-by-character)
- **Privacy**: Completely offline processing
- **Reliability**: Production-ready daily driver quality

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Fn key not detected**: Check Input Monitoring permission
2. **Character-by-character typing**: TCC cache bug - remove/re-add in Accessibility
3. **No AI enhancement**: Check Ollama installation and Python venv
4. **Text doesn't appear**: Verify both Accessibility and Input Monitoring permissions

### Debug Output
```bash
/Applications/STT\ Dictate.app/Contents/MacOS/STTDictate
```

## Phase 4 Roadmap

### Advanced AI Features
- **Custom Voice Commands**: User-defined text editing commands
- **Multi-Language Support**: Automatic language detection
- **Personal Dictionary**: Learn user-specific vocabulary and names
- **Cloud Model Options**: Optionally use cloud AI for better accuracy

### Hands-Free Features
- **Voice Activity Detection**: Auto-start/stop on speech detection
- **Wake Word Detection**: "Hey STT" activation
- **Continuous Listening**: Background voice processing

## Architecture Inspiration

Our session-based approach was inspired by analyzing Wispr Flow's architecture, implementing:

1. **End-to-End Processing**: Process complete conversations, not fragments
2. **Local-First Privacy**: Keep audio and processing on-device
3. **Instant Output**: Use system clipboard for immediate text insertion
4. **Context Awareness**: Adapt output based on target application
5. **Polish Over Speed**: Better to wait 1-2 seconds for perfect text
