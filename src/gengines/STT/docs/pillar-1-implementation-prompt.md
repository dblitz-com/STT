# PILLAR 1 Technical Implementation Deep Dive: Always-On Vision Workflow Understanding

## Mission Statement
Generate extremely detailed technical implementation specifications for the Always-On Vision Workflow Understanding PRD. This must include production-ready code examples, specific algorithms, data structures, optimization techniques, and integration patterns that enable zero-shot implementation without additional research.

## Context: What We Need to Build

Based on the PRD, we need to implement 4 core features:
1. **Workflow Detection**: Real-time detection of task boundaries and app switches
2. **Activity Summarization**: 30-second sliding window activity summaries
3. **Pattern Learning**: Statistical learning of user behavior patterns
4. **Temporal Queries**: Natural language queries about past activities

## Current Technical Foundation (Existing Code)

### Base Architecture
```python
# continuous_vision_service.py - EXISTING IMPLEMENTATION
class ContinuousVisionService:
    def __init__(self, capture_fps: float = 1.0):
        self.capture_fps = capture_fps
        self.running = False
        self.last_frame_hash = None
        self.vision_service = VisionService(disable_langfuse=True)
        self.mem0_client = mem0.Memory()  # NEEDS UPGRADE TO WEAVIATE
