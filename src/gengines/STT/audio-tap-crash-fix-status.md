# STT Dictate Audio Tap Crash Fix - CRITICAL TEST

## What We Fixed üîß

The research agent identified the **root cause**: 
- AVAudioEngine's `reset()` method does NOT remove existing audio taps
- Installing a new tap while an old one exists causes a format conflict crash
- This happens especially on toggle scenarios (start/stop recording cycles)

## The Solution Applied ‚úÖ

**Before `installTap()`:**
```swift
// Remove any existing tap to prevent conflicts (safe even if none exists)
inputNode.removeTap(onBus: 0)
NSLog("üóëÔ∏è Removed any existing audio tap")

// Now safe to install new tap
inputNode.installTap(onBus: 0, bufferSize: 1024, format: inputFormat) { ... }
```

**In `stopRecording()`:**
```swift
// Remove tap before stopping engine
audioEngine.inputNode.removeTap(onBus: 0)
audioEngine.stop()
```

## Ready for CRITICAL TEST üéØ

The app is now running with the fix. **This should eliminate the crash entirely.**

### Test Sequence:
1. **Look for ‚ö° lightning bolt** in menu bar
2. **Click it** ‚Üí menu should appear
3. **Click "Toggle Dictation (Fn)"**

### Expected Results:
- **SUCCESS**: No crash, icon changes to red/recording state, notification shows "Recording started"
- **FAILURE**: App still crashes (very unlikely now - would indicate deeper issue)

### What to Test After Success:
1. **Multiple toggles** - Start/stop recording several times
2. **Audio detection** - Speak and see if microphone is actually picking up audio
3. **Permission stability** - Ensure microphone access remains granted

## This Fix Should Work Because:
- ‚úÖ Targets the exact crash location identified in stack trace
- ‚úÖ Addresses the specific AVAudioEngine format conflict issue  
- ‚úÖ Uses the research agent's proven solution pattern
- ‚úÖ No system-level changes needed (permissions/entitlements already correct)
- ‚úÖ Safe operations that won't break anything else

## Next Steps After Test:
- **If successful**: Move to Fn key interception debugging
- **If still crashes**: Implement CoreAudio fallback approach
- **If works**: Test actual speech-to-text transcription

## PLEASE TEST NOW
Click the ‚ö° icon and select "Toggle Dictation (Fn)" to see if the crash is finally resolved!
