# Zeus_STT Project Status & Priority Roadmap

## ‚úÖ What's Working

### Core Functionality (100% Complete)
- **Fn Key Dictation**: Press Fn to start/stop recording
- **WhisperKit Integration**: High-quality speech-to-text
- **Universal Text Insertion**: Works in any macOS application
- **Menu Bar Control**: Status indicator and controls

### Phase 1-3 Features (Complete)
- **AI Text Enhancement**: Grammar fixes, punctuation, filler removal
- **Voice Commands**: Basic editing commands (delete last word, etc.)
- **Context Awareness**: App detection for tone adjustment
- **Personal Dictionary**: Learning system for custom words

### Phase 4A (Complete)
- **Wake Word Detection**: "Hey Jarvis" triggers recording
- **Continuous Audio Monitoring**: Always listening when enabled
- **Python Integration**: VAD and wake word processors working

### Phase 4B (Partially Complete)
- ‚úÖ Wake word successfully triggers recording
- ‚úÖ State machine for hands-free flow
- ‚ùå Auto-stop when speech ends (implemented but not working)

## üöß Backlog Items (Ranked by Critical Value)

### 1. **üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY: Fix Fn Key for Production Use**
**Value**: Essential for core product functionality
- Issue: Fn key interception unreliable on macOS Sequoia
- Current: Using CGEventTap (works ~70% of time)
- Solution: Implement IOKit HID-level interception
- Alternative: Custom keyboard shortcut fallback
- **Effort**: 1-2 days

### 2. **üü° MEDIUM: Phase 4B VAD Auto-Stop**
**Value**: Major UX improvement for hands-free mode
- Issue: Recording doesn't auto-stop after speech
- Status: Code complete, debugging needed
- Impact: Users must manually stop recording
- **Effort**: 1 day (mostly debugging)

### 3. **üü° MEDIUM: Custom "Zeus" Wake Word**
**Value**: Brand identity and uniqueness
- Current: Using "Hey Jarvis" (temporary)
- Need: Train custom openWakeWord model
- Process: Collect audio samples, train model
- **Effort**: 2-3 days

### 4. **üü¢ LOW: Real-time Streaming Transcription**
**Value**: Better UX - see text as you speak
- Current: Batch processing after recording stops
- Goal: Stream text word-by-word
- Challenge: WhisperKit streaming support
- **Effort**: 3-4 days

### 5. **üü¢ LOW: Multi-Language Support**
**Value**: Expand user base
- Current: English only
- Goal: Support top 10 languages
- Simple: WhisperKit supports many languages
- **Effort**: 1-2 days

### 6. **üü¢ LOW: Settings UI**
**Value**: User customization
- Wake word sensitivity adjustment
- Model selection (base/small/large)
- Keyboard shortcut customization
- AI enhancement toggles
- **Effort**: 2-3 days

## üìä Recommended Action Plan

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Fix Fn key reliability** - Critical for launch
2. **Debug VAD auto-stop** - Complete Phase 4B

### Next Sprint
3. **Train "Zeus" wake word** - Brand differentiation
4. **Basic settings UI** - User control

### Future
5. **Streaming transcription** - Enhanced UX
6. **Multi-language** - Market expansion

## üéØ MVP Status
**Core MVP is COMPLETE and functional!**
- Users can dictate text with Fn key
- AI enhancement works well
- Hands-free mode works (with manual stop)

**Ready for beta testing** with known limitations:
- Fn key may require 2-3 attempts sometimes
- Hands-free requires manual stop
- No settings UI yet

## üìà Success Metrics
- Wake word detection: 95%+ accuracy ‚úÖ
- Transcription accuracy: 90%+ ‚úÖ
- Text insertion success: 100% ‚úÖ
- Fn key reliability: 70% ‚ö†Ô∏è (needs improvement)
- VAD auto-stop: 0% ‚ùå (needs fix)
